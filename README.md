## Installation
1. Download the latest `.alfredworkflow` file from the [releases page](https://github.com/Klizzy/alfred-hide-my-mail/releases).
2. Double-click the downloaded file to import it into Alfred 5.

## Usage
1. Open Alfred (default shortcut: `Option + Space`).
2. Type `hide` followed by the label you want to assign to the new iCloud Hide My Mail address.
3. Press `Enter`.
4. Press `CMD + V` to paste the generated iCloud Hide My Mail address.

The workflow will open the MacOS System Settings, navigate to the appropriate section, create a new iCloud Hide My Mail address with the specified label and adds the generate mail to your clipboard.

## Requirements

1. Alfred 5.1 or later
2. Active [iCloud+](https://support.apple.com/guide/icloud/mm9d9012c9e8/icloud) subscription
3. MacOS 14.1 or later

## Configuration

You can change the keyword to trigger the workflow by opening the Alfred Preferences, navigating to the `Workflows` tab, selecting the `Hide My Mail` workflow, and clicking on the `Configure Workflow` button. Here you can change the keyword to your desired value.
- The default keyword is `hide`.

## Why?

On some websites you don't get the native icloud+ hide my mail prompt for the email field, so it has to be created manually.
The complete process is automated with this workflow, so you don't have to click 8-10 times through the system settings to get your generated mail.
